# HOSPITAL-ANALYSIS
A DASHBOARD THAT DISPLAYS THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PATIENT
## PROJECT OVERVIEW

THIS PROJECT HAS THE DASHBOARD THAT DISPLAYS ALL THE RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PATIENT. THE DROPDOWN HAS PATIENT ID. ADMIT DATE,DISCHARGE DATE,FOLLOWUP DATE,TYPE OF BED, NAME OF THE DOCTOR AND THE REASON FOR THE TREATMENT. IT ALSO GIVES INSIGHTS ABOUT THE BILLING AMOUNT AND THE INSURANCE AMOUNT.
## Overall Objective
This dashboard enables data-driven decision making across patient care, resource utilization, service quality, and financial management.

Hospitals often struggle to monitor patient flow, resource usage, diagnosis trends, and financial efficiency in a consolidated way. This dashboard provides an integrated solution to enable timely, data-informed decisions to improve patient care and operational efficiency. Also helps to monitor the performance of the doctors according to the feedback given and also helps to figure out the satisfaction level of the patients. 



### DATA SOURCE

## PROBLEM SOLVED
 Helps track the timeline of a patient's hospitalization and recovery, which is crucial for resource planning, scheduling follow-ups, and improving continuity of care.
 Allows hospital administrators to understand the current strain on different types of beds and make decisions on resource allocation or expansions.
 Gives insights into patient satisfaction levels with doctors, aiding in performance management, training, or reward decisions.
Helps identify which illnesses are most prevalent. Useful for epidemic tracking, staffing, and inventory management (e.g., more flu cases = more vaccines needed).
 Helps identify revenue gaps, monitor insurance coverage effectiveness, and optimize billing policies. E.g., Fracture cases have high billing-to-insurance discrepancy.
